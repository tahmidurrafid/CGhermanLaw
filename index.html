					<ul>
						<li>Graduated Queens College Magna Cum Laude with Honors in Psychology.</li>
						<li>Was accepted to Dental School but decided that a mouth couldn't be my workspace for my career.</li>
						<li>Applied to law school, got a full scholarship to Hofstra University School of Law, was on Law Review and graduated With Honors ... all while married, and during which I became a father twice (the first one on the day of my first year Property final exam - that's a great story...).</li>
						<li>Worked in the Global M&A Department in the Manhattan office of a major Big Law firm (Milbank) for about 6 years.</li>
						<li>"Left it all on the table" (to quote a friend) to move to Israel, where I was admitted to the bar (in addition to my admission to the NY bar).</li>
						<li>For more than 11 years practiced at a law firm of former US Big Law attorneys who also pursued their ideals and dreams to live in Israel, yet demanded to continue to practice law and service clients at the same level as their Big Law days.</li>
						<li>While a partner at such law firm, grew a US and Israeli law practice for US and Israeli clients (working both Israel and US hours) in the following practice areas: corporate, M&A, investments (private equity, start-ups, etc), and commercial/business, and then...</li>
						<li>Left the comforts of firm life and took the plunge to start my own solo practice.</li>
						<li>My clients range from public companies to start-ups to mom-and-pop-shops - who all get the same maximum effort, care and attention that I can provide.</li>

				But, really, I am a lot more than my education and career. So many of us corporate attorneys have similar educations and work experience. What makes us different - in my opinion - 
				is the person behind the lawyer. When you hire a lawyer to be your advocate, your guide and advisor for you or your company, in a transaction or if you are in a bind,
				you are establishing a very important relationship. You don't just want a lawyer. You want a person you can trust, confide in and connect to who is going to work for you as your lawyer. 
				I am very confident that I can be that person for you. And while some lawyers may claim to be everything for everyone (especially solo practitioners), I don't. You see, I don't want to be 
				everyone's lawyer, I want to be your lawyer.
